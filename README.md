# L2048
A modified version of the classic 2048 game!!
Use your arrow keys to move the little squares around, and keep trying to get to the 2048 tile!
P.S. nobody knows what the 2048 tile actually is....
This project was made by Liam (please call him Lenni,) and the original 2048 game creator!

This one linked probably makes more sense, but this project is a reminder that you can do whatever you put your mind to!
Have fun!
